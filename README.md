# This is my first **repository**

This is my first __repository__, first __README__ and first **MARKDOWN** language.

This repository also contain my first ever  short codes in a new language. Every success story requires a first step.
As Mark Twain said:
>The secrete of getting ahead
>is getting started.

#### Untill now I have only started these languages:
1. [x] Hyper Text Markup Language (**html**)
    .MarkDown (**md**)
2. [x] cascading Stylesheets (**css**)
3. [x] JavaScript (**js**)
